7.Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears 
only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.
Example 1:
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
PROGRAM:
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
def deleteDuplicates(head):
    if not head or not head.next:
        return head
    current = head
    while current and current.next:
        if current.val == current.next.val:
            current.next = current.next.next
        else:
            current = current.next
    return head
def printLinkedList(head):
    vals = []
    current = head
    while current:
        vals.append(current.val)
        current = current.next
    print(vals)
head = ListNode(1, ListNode(1, ListNode(2,)))
head = deleteDuplicates(head)
printLinkedList(head)
